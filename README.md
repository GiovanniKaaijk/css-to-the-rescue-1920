## Description

During this course, I wanted to create a website in the most glitchy way possible. For this, I was only allowed to use CSS. There were also some restrictions on the CSS, I wanted to use dark/light mode, two colors and SVG paths/animations. I used loads of keyframes to get the result as it is.

## Experiments

During this course, I learned the following things
- ::root
- :target
- :nth-child(n + )
- clip-path
- perspective
- blend-modes
- filters
- custom properties
- animation-timing-functions
- fill-mode
- SVG styling
- ```~``` sibling selector
- ```+``` close selector
- cubic-bezier
- white-space
- translate3d()

## Design choises

- I chose to not use prefers-color-scheme since a lot of people don't know about their computer having this feature. I chose to use a simple toggle to change the root colours instead.
- I chose to not use reduced motion, because the animations are the main features of the website. Without the keyframes my website would visiually be less attractive.
